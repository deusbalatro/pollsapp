Hi!

# Django Polls App

This is a simple Django application for conducting polls. It was created based on the [Django tutorial found in the official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/).

## Features

- Allows users to view a list of polls
- Enables users to vote on polls
- Provides an administration interface for managing polls and choices

You can easily learn Django's folder structure and MVT concept.

I hope it will be useful for ya.

Bye!
